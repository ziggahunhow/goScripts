## GO Scripts

###### This project uses simple scripts that facilitate my development

###### csvToJson

While working on React Intl, there's a constant need to update several language.json files when new language content is added. This script is thus developed in order to map values from a csv file into json. (sample csv file is the text.csv)

###### orderJson

Simple script to set json file's content alphabetically.
